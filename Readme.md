# Audio Chapter Editor for Windows 11

This is a audio chapter editor tool for Windows 11, built using WinUI 3. It's straightforward, minimal, (hopefully) good-looking, and useful if you're looking for a tool to embed podcast chapters in Windows. Such a tool exists out there for Mac, and Descript and other such tools can embed chapter marks in files they create, but if you want to edit these frames thereafter, this is the tool for you.

I plan to put this on the Windows Store when it's slightly more feature-complete; right now it's in the hardening phase.

_This tool is majorly indebted to the [ATL.NET audio library](https://github.com/Zeugma440/atldotnet), which is wonderful and makes the backend of this rather straightforward._
